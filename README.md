# S3 CLI Tool

A command-line interface (CLI) tool to manage AWS S3 buckets and objects. This tool allows you to perform common S3 operations like creating/deleting buckets, uploading files with MIME type validation, and more.

## Features

- List all S3 buckets
- Create and delete S3 buckets
- Check if an S3 bucket exists
- Upload files to S3 with MIME type validation (images and video formats)
- Set public read access to uploaded files
- Fix permission issues by removing the public access block

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- AWS account with access to S3
- AWS credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and optionally a Session Token)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management (or you can use `pip` directly)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/s3-cli-tool.git
   cd s3-cli-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use `pip`:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory with your AWS credentials:
   
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
   AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token (optional)
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1 (or your preferred region)
   ```

## Available Commands

### 1. `list_buckets`
Lists all S3 buckets in your AWS account.

```sh
python3 main.py list_buckets
```

### 2. `create_bucket <bucket_name>`
Creates an S3 bucket in the specified region. If the region is `us-east-1`, it won't require a location constraint.

```sh
python3 main.py create_bucket <bucket_name>
```

### 3. `delete_bucket <bucket_name>`
Deletes the specified S3 bucket. The bucket must be empty before deletion. This command will empty the bucket before deletion.

```sh
python3 main.py delete_bucket <bucket_name>
```

### 4. `bucket_exists <bucket_name>`
Checks if the specified S3 bucket exists.

```sh
python3 main.py bucket_exists <bucket_name>
```

### 5. `upload_file <file_path> <bucket_name> <object_name>`
Uploads a file to S3 after validating the MIME type. Only the following MIME types are allowed:

- `image/bmp`
- `image/jpeg`
- `image/png`
- `image/webp`
- `video/mp4`

```sh
python3 main.py upload_file <file_path> <bucket_name> <object_name>
```

Example:
```sh
python3 main.py upload_file ~/Pictures/Screenshot\ from\ 2025-03-06\ 15-23-27.png my-bucket Screenshot\ from\ 2025-03-06\ 15-23-27.png
```

### 6. `delete_public_access_block <bucket_name>`
Removes the public access block from the specified bucket.

```sh
python3 main.py delete_public_access_block <bucket_name>
```

## Environment Variables

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS Access Key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS Secret Access Key
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: Your AWS Session Token (optional)
- `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region where your S3 buckets are located (e.g., `us-east-1`)

## Example Usage

```sh
# List all S3 buckets
python3 main.py list_buckets

# Create a new bucket
python3 main.py create_bucket my-new-bucket

# Check if a bucket exists
python3 main.py bucket_exists my-new-bucket

# Upload a file
python3 main.py upload_file /path/to/file.jpg my-bucket file.jpg

# Delete a bucket
python3 main.py delete_bucket my-old-bucket

# Remove public access block
python3 main.py delete_public_access_block my-bucket
```

## Logging

This tool uses Pythonâ€™s `logging` module to log information about operations. Logs are printed in the following format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,SSS - LEVEL - MESSAGE
```

You can adjust the logging level or output format by modifying the `logging.basicConfig()` settings in the code.

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" error when accessing uploaded file

This error typically occurs when the file is not publicly accessible. To resolve this, ensure that the `set_object_access_policy` function is correctly called after uploading the file, setting the ACL to `public-read`.

### InvalidLocationConstraint error when creating a bucket

This error can happen if the region is not correctly specified. Ensure that you are specifying the correct region in your `.env` file. For example, use `us-east-1` or another valid AWS region.
